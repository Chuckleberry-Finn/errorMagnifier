B41/B42+:
NEW: UI Overhaul! ErrorMag now uses a window!
  The error mag button is always present (on the main-menu or in the pause-menu).
  Only appears during gameplay when an error occurs, right-clicking it in-game hides it.
NEW: 'Mods' tab houses all the mods receiving errors, the copy button here copies just the errors from that mod.
NEW: 'Reports' API for other modders to include a useful information dump to go along with their errors.

Only B42+: Open console log location no longer supported by TIS. :(

HOTFIX:
  Small error when copying all.
  Cleaner error output.
[ ------ ]

[ 2/2/26 ]
- Added handy useful PZ-info dump as standard header.
  Includes game version, game-mode, and luachecksum flag.
- Fixed some issues with modID identification.
- Added status message for copy/clear all.
  Also made it so they're disabled when error count is 0.
